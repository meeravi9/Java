1. What is Inheritance  or what is Is-a relationship? - The "is-a" relationship is established through inheritance. It signifies that one class is 
a subclass (child) of another class (parent). 
The child class inherits properties and behaviors from the parent class. 
 
2. what is Composition or what is Has-a relationship? - The "has-a" relationship is established through composition. 
It means that one class contains an object of another class as part of its state.

3. What is Association or what is Usses-a relationship? - The "uses-a" relationship signifies that one class uses the functionality of another 
class without being part of its state.

These relationships are essential in object-oriented design as they help create meaningful and modular code. "Is-a" relationship represents 
inheritance, "has-a" relationship represents composition, and "uses-a" relationship represents association, each serving different purposes
 in the design of classes and theirÂ interactions.
